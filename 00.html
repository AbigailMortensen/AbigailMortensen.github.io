    <h4>How I Completed 00</h4>
    <p>
    If you choose to use Vagrant, it will take a substantial amount of time to get the VM running and for everything to download. <br> <br>
    Prior to this tutorial, I was not familiar with the git clone command. If you are also new to git clone, there are two ways to perform it (option 2 is much easier): <br>

    <ol>
      <li>Configure your Github account to use a new or existing SSH key</li>
        <ol>
          <li>If you have not generated an SSH key before, you must do that before 1.2. See
             <a href = "https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">here</a> for how.</li>
          <li> If you have already generated an SSH key, or if you have already
             completed step 1.1, see <a href = "https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">here</a>
             for how to connect it with your GitHub.</li>
        </ol>

      <br>
      <li>Go to <a href= "https://github.com/inveniosoftware/training">here</a> and click on the &quot;clone or download&quot; button in the top right of the page
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure what you clicked says &quot;Clone with HTTPS&quot;.</li>
          <li>Copy and paste the HTTPS link to your terminal after typing
             &quot;git clone&quot;, replacing the git clone command recommended
             in the tutorial.</li>
        </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>

    <br> Initially, I attempted to use Vagrant, which I had not used before. I ran into a host of issues:

    <ul>
      <li>My first attempt with my personal computer: after typing the git clone,
         my terminal froze up trying to download items.</li>
      <li>My second attempt, using a mac, successfully allowed me to use vagrant
         up and vagrant ssh.</li>
      <li>When I got to tutorial 01 - Getting Started, I was not able to run
        ./scripts/bootstrap. Which then in turn did not allow me to create
        ./scripts/setup or ./scripts/server. In order for these scripts to work
        I had to run additional scripts not mentioned in the tutorial.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    I then switched over to VirtualBox and followed the prerequisite steps without issue!

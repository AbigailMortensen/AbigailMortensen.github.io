    <h1>10 - Modifying Records Before Indexing</h1>

    <h4>Main Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taken from the Invenio tutorial 10: The goal of this tutorial is to
          learn how to take advantage of Elasticsearch by manipulating records
          fields when indexing</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>

      ****Warning For This Tutorial
      <br>Use the Step 1: Bootstrap exercise with extreme caution. It will get
      rid of all previous changes made to files/folders in any tutorials prior.
      <br><br>
      Step 3: I had many issues upon this step. Ultimately, I was not able to
      solve my issue and had to delete any changes I made to my instance during
      tutorial 10 in order to move on to complete proceeding tutorials, but these
      are the steps I took to attempt to solve my problem.

      <ol>
        <li>I triple checked that I correctly did step 2.</li>
        <li>I copied the solution files contained in the training directory to
          their proper location in the my-site directory and attempted completing
          step 3. This allowed me to successfully complete up until &quot;pipenv
          run invenio index run&quot;.</li>
        <li>At this point, I had been using the step1 bootstrap, so I redid
          previous tutorials 07-09 to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing any dependent
          changes made in previous tutorials. This allowed me to get further in
          step 3, but I could not successfully complete the last step of step 3.</li>
      </ol>

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>
    <p>
      This tutorial is a very brief introduction to front-end development with
      Invenio Framework. The visual alterations made to the website in this
      tutorial will not be important to later tutorials. If you are unfamiliar
      with CSS or HTML, these few steps may be confusing.

      <br><br>This is also the first tutorial where we navigate around within
      the files of ~/src/my-site. The multitude of files may be confusing--if
      you would like a visual of the file system where you can see folders and
      files in relation to each other, look at ~/src&#39;s contents on Ubuntu&#39;s
      GUI for files (which comes automatically if you are using VirtualBox).

    <h1>About This Documentation </h1>

    <h3>How to Use This Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This guide is best suited to those unfamiliar with the
        terminologies/technologies mentioned in the Invenio tutorials.</li>
      <li>This documentation was written so that the reader may look at tutorial
         sections individually without having to read all the info for the tutorials
         before. For this reason, there is some repetitive information throughout.</li>
      <li>Subscripted numbers denote an id for a hyperlink, where you may find
        the full link in the Referenced Link section of this documentation if the
        hyperlink doesn&#39;t work.</li>
      <li>This guide would be well suited to those wanting to read about someone
        else&#39;s experience with the tutorials before performing the tutorials
        themselves.</li>
      <li>The last section, Useful Information, is  a sort of summation of the
        information provided in later tutorials.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Background on This Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This guide contains my notes and thoughts as I went through the
        Invenio tutorials.</li>
      <li>Prior to the tutorials, I was a novice in my understanding of Invenio
        and the software it was built with.</li>
      <li>There are two tutorials I was not able to successfully complete;
        my notes are not perfect but I have tried to make them as helpful as
        possible as I have included advice I wished I had known prior to each tutorial.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Supplementary Materials</h3>
    <p>I highly recommend reading supplementary materials either prior to, or in
       conjunction with, the completion of each tutorial. It is not until later
       tutorials that you will receive a more detailed explanation of why you
       are doing each step. I will be adding links to reading materials for each
       tutorial if applicable.

    <h3>Bootstrap Warning</h3>
    <p>
      Starting with Tutorial 07, there will be an optional first step to most
       tutorials in which you can use a &quot;start-from&quot; script to start
       from a clean slate. Be aware that this will erase all changes made to
       your ~/src/my-site in prior tutorials.

    <h1>11 - Linking Records</h1>

    <h4>Main Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a GUI component for a simple deposit form</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>
    <p>
     We will be creating a JSON resolver and creating a $ref attribute to link
     records together. This tutorial has easy to understand explanations for why
     each step is being done.

      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br>Step 3 and 4: As with previous tutorials, make sure to watch your Python spacing.
      <br><br>Step 5: If, like me, you were not able to complete tutorial 10,
      make sure to erase all work you had done to your Invenio instance in tutorial
      10. Changes made in the previous tutorial may keep this tutorial from working.

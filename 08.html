    <h1>08 - Data Models: Build From Scratch</h1>

    <h4>Main Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create your own data model from scratch</li>
        <li>Learn about the components that form a data model</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing 08</h4>
    <p>
     This tutorial shows you how to create a new data model by building your own
     python files that utilize marshmallow, elasticsearch mappings, JSONSchema
     mappings, loaders, serializers, and more. This module has a lot of working
     with uncommenting Python code. If you are new to Python, and are not familiar
     with their indentation and commenting rules, it is integral you be familiar
     with these two concepts in particular so you know what to uncomment.
     You may view <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statement-indentation-and-comment-in-python/">this</a>
     for help.

      <br><br>****Warning For This Tutorial
      <br>Use the Step 1: Bootstrap exercise with extreme caution. It will get
      rid of all previous changes made to files/folders in any tutorials prior.
      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br>Step 2: location for setup.py is ~/src/my-site/setup.py
      <br><br>When it says to uncomment the code found in my_site/authors/ext.py,
      you are to uncomment all of ext.py that is feasible python code. Specifically,
      uncomment everything below &quot; &quot; &quot; Flask extension for My site.
      &quot; &quot; &quot; , but if text is surrounded by three sets of quotes,
      leave it alone because three quotes denotes a comment in Python.
      <br><br>Step 4: I believe there is a typo in this step, it tells us we
      should be initializing record serializers but instead it tells us to
      uncomment record_loaders, which we did in the previous step. If the steps
      are followed exactly, record_serializers will never be initialized (and we
      will get an error in several steps further when we have to run ./scripts/setup).
      To initialize the record_serializers like we are trying to, uncomment line
      34-37 in ~/src/my-site/my_site/authors/serializers/__init__.py

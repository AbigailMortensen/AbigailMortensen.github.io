    <h1>06 - Developing with Invenio</h1>

    <h4>Main Purpose</h4>
    <p>
     <ul>
      <li>Create a git repository</li>
      <li>Learn how to build documentation in GitHub</li>
      <li>Work with test cases</li>
     </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing 06</h4>
    <p>
     This is an interesting tutorial. In my opinion, the most pragmatic section
     of this tutorial is learning how to perform end-to-end testing and learning
     how to install a new Python dependency.

      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br>Step 6: Unfortunately I was not able to get this step to work. I am
      unsure of what I did wrong as I checked over my steps multiple times and
      still received the same errors I got prior to making the change to
      test/e2e/test_front_page.py.

      <br><br>Step 7: prior to using git commit -m &quot;global: added Pillow
      package&quot; you must register who you are with git by using these
      commands: git config --global user.email &#8249;emailhere&#8250; and git
      config --global user.name &#8249;namehere&#8250;.

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>
    <p>
     This tutorial is easy to follow and is fairly informative on what the
     different steps are doing. This tutorial involves writing Python code that
     is given to you. If you are unfamiliar with Python indentation or commenting
     syntax, you may view <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statement-indentation-and-comment-in-python/">this</a>.

      <br><br>****Warning For This Tutorial
      <br>Use the Step 1: Bootstrap exercise with extreme caution. It will get
      rid of all previous changes made to files/folders in any tutorials prior.
      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br>Step 6: I received a Traceback error after entering the information in
      the form--rather than seeing a success message. I checked my work and had
      completed all the steps, therefore it was likely I had a typo somewhere in
      the code I typed.
      <br>My solution: Utilize the solution files provided by Invenio in the training folder
      <br>copy the solution files in the training folder to the destinations mentioned
      in the tutorials using the command: cp &#8249;source&#8250; &#8249;destination&#8250;
    <br>&#8249;source&#8250; was ~/src/training/09-deposit-form/solution/my-site/my_site/deposit/&#8249;whichever .py or .html form&#8250;

    <h4>Guide to Completing 02</h4>
     <p>
      ****If you are new to localhosts/development servers
      <br>If you choose to close the development server(by closing the tab running
      the development server) on your localhost, no information that you input
      into the server previously will be saved. For instance, if you created an
      administrator user account, this account would be deleted once the server
      it was created on is shut down.

      <br><br>****If you are new to the command line
      <br> To complete step 4, open up a separate terminal window from the window
      that is running the web server from the last tutorial. In this new window,
      go to the my-site directory by typing &quot;cd ~/src/my-site&quot;. The
      command you type is from &quot;curl -k --header&quot; to
      &quot;prettyprint=1&quot;. Note, the &#39;\&#39; character allows you to press
      enter without executing the command--if you don&#39;t want to press enter
      to visually format the command, you may omit the &#39;\&#39;.

      <br><br> ***** What is the OAI-PMH endpoint and why do we care about it?
      <br> OAI-PMH is a protocol for metadata harvesting. OAI-PMH defines
      a &quot;verb&quot; (a command) called &quot;Identify&quot;, which we use
      in Step 8 to access descriptive information about the repository.
      See section 4.2 of this <a href = "http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">link</a>
      for more information on &quot;Identify&quot; or OAI-PMH.

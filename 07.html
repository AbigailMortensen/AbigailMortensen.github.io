    <h1>07 - Data Models New Field</h1>

    <h4>Main Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to create a new field in a data model</li>
        <li>Learn about the different mappings/schemas/serializers that support data models</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>
    <p>
      This is an important module because you learn about the inner workings of
      an  Invenio data model. Prior to performing the module, I highly recommend
      getting a general understanding of how Invenio defines a &quot;data model&quot;
      and getting used to the terminology of serializer, loader, mappings, and
      schemas--which you may do <a href= "https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/understanding-data-models.html">here</a>.
      This tutorial has brief, clear explanations for why you are doing each step.

      <br><br> If you are not familiar with Python&#39;s indentation rules, read
      <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statement-indentation-and-comment-in-python/">this</a>.

      <br><br>****If you are new to Python
      <br>Step 4: Python is not a &quot;free form&quot; language, which means
      that indentation of code blocks has to be specifically placed. If you are
      unsure what this means, you don&#39;t need to worry about it yet--just
      make sure that any code you put into a Python file(ends in .py) lines up
      with the code around it, and do not use the &quot;tab&quot; bar to do so.
      In the example below, the top version will work, the bottom version will
      give you errors because of the extra space before owner.

      <br><br>contributors = Nested(ContributorSchemaV1, many=True, required=True)
      <br>owner = fields.Integer()

      <br><br>contributors = Nested(ContributorSchemaV1, many=True, required=True)
      <br>&nbsp;owner = fields.Integer()

      <br><br>****Warning For This Tutorial
      <br> Use the Step 1: Bootstrap exercise with extreme caution. It will
      get rid of all previous changes made to files/folders in any tutorials prior.

      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br>Step 5: If ./scripts/setup or ./scripts/server will not work
      <br>During my first attempt of this step, I had a previous web server
      running, and something running in (my-site) virutalenv. I performed
      ./scripts/setup without issue, and then ./scripts/server said I had open
      nodes running, so I then closed my previous 2 previous servers and ran 
      ./scripts/setup and ./scripts/server again, both of which gave me errors
      that did not allow the scripts to work. Essentially, somewhere a mistake
      in my steps prevented ./scripts/setup or ./scripts/server from running properly,
      even after trying multiple times.
      <br> My solution: go to ~/src/training and put in the command:
      ./start-from.sh 05-customizing-invenio

      <br><br>Step 7: Where do I find this file I&#39;m supposed to change?
      <br>~/src/my_site/records/marshmallow/json.py

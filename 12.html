        <li>Creating access permissions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Guide to Completing</h4>
    <p>
     We are creating a permissions factory module that defines a function that
     searches for the user&#39;s id. This permissions factory is then imported
     into records configuration file so that to edit, view, or delete a JSON record
     of a file you must verify that you are its owner. In the records config file
     you edit both the REST API endpoints (so you cannot view it in the JSON format)
     and the UI endpoints (so you cannot view information in the user interface either).


      <br><br>As a heads up, the completion of this tutorial will make it more
      difficult to view records or add records through the REST API or website
      UI, so make sure to use just the usernames and passwords provided by the
      tutorial so you don&#39;t forget login information and lose access to record
      information.

      <br><br>****Troubleshooting
      <br> Step 2.3- remove the previous search_class variable before setting
      search_class equal to OwnerRecordsSearch.

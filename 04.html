    <h4>Guide to Completing 04</h4>
     <p>
       The &quot;invenio&quot; command can only be used in a python virtual
       environment, which you may run by typing &quot;pipenv shell&quot; while
       in the directory ~/src/my-site. You will need to be familiar with how
       to access this virtual environment in later tutorials. When in this
       environment, you may pull up a Python shell or you may access the invenio
       shell with the command &quot;invenio shell&quot;. If you are unfamiliar with
       some of this terminology, check out these links:

       <br><br>****Why do we access the Python shell and Invenio shell?
       <br>Within a Python shell, you may write Python code that is instantly
       executed but will be erased once you exit the shell (via a technology
       called REPL, Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) . However, this Python shell comes
       as a blank slate for you to practice/test Python code in, with nothing
       pre-installed. The invenio shell is a Python shell complete with pre-loaded
       configurations and extensions that allow you perform high-level APIs
       without needing to know low-level details. You will learn more about
       the pragmatic uses of the invenio shell in later tutorials.
